        <h1>Stands</h1>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
          <p>Stands are defined as personifications of "life energy" (although it's later changed to "spiritual energy") whose abilities are given visual form. When first presented, the term is written as "Stand" (幽波紋スタンド Sutando), with furiganaW to change the pronunciation of what literally means "Ghostly Ripple" (幽波紋 Yūhamon) in kanjiW. According to Joseph Joestar, the name "Stand" comes from the fact they usually manifest standing next to the User: ready to act. Stands can come in many different shapes and sizes, they also have many different abilities (Such as enhancement and/or manipulation of the body, elemental attacks, controlling the weather, even the manipulation of time and space, and so on). The only power that's truly impossible for a Stand is bringing the dead back to life.</p>

          <p>A Stand can also represent the manifestation of an individual's innate "fighting spirit" and embodies, to an extent, the individual's psyche. However, Stands may also derive through the exploration of possibilities and expression of the mind, in which case, only a large amount of mental strength is required. Beyond that definition, Stands present themselves in a large variety of forms and with different behaviors, if they are sentient at all. They follow a loose set of rules, with no definite standard by which one can fully classify them. As an embodiment of someone's psyche, Stands are therefore as varied as human minds can be. Due to their diversity, Stands are not made equal. Some can be incredibly powerful due to their User's outstanding grit, others can be highly situational because of a defining quirk of character, or even detrimental to their User if they do not have the necessary fighting spirit.</p>
          <p>When Stands were first introduced in Stardust Crusaders, they were named after the cards of the Major Arcana of the TarotW, and sometimes a color (the color of the Stands body), and then Ancient Egyptian deitiesW, with their designs often featuring motifs of those cards or mythological figures. Towards the end of Stardust Crusaders and in all subsequent story arcs, Stand names are references to musicians, bands, albums, and songs from American, Australian, British, and European music scenes; only one Stand's name has ever referenced Japanese music.</p>

          <p>Stands are connected to an alien virus contained in the rock of a meteorite that fell in Cape York, Greenland tens of thousands of years ago. It is explained that the virus can infect people and for the most part kills them, but the few who survive are granted a Stand ability. A man once used rock from the meteorite to create a number arrowheads that could awaken the stand of anyone whom they pierced.</p>
          <h2>Stand users</h2>
          <p>The Stand is created from someone's psyche, which includes not only humans but also other living creatures. That individual is referred to as the Stand User. The User then gives their Stand a name and uses it for various purposes.</p>
          <img src="img/standwound.webp" class="feetpics" width="250px">
          <p>Unless bound to a specific object or automatic, Stands are attached to their User's body. In that case, any damage the Stand sustains results in an equivalent injury on the User's body and vice-versa. Exceptions to this rule include automatic Stands and bound Stands, which usually do not reflect the damage into the User, or special abilities like Silver Chariot's armor.</p>
          <p>Except for rare occasions, when a Stand User dies, their Stand disappears with them. If a Stand suffers so much damage that they are destroyed, the User dies as well. This includes immortal beings, like Vampires. However, a User can survive with their Stand destroyed[5] if the Stand is automatic or depending on the level of the User's injury. Inversely, some Stands can survive beyond their Users through exceptional abilities like Notorious B.I.G.</p>
          <p>Since a Stand is the form of its User's psyche, they share an intimate psychic bond. First and foremost, Stands usually obey their Users' command without question. If a User demands it, the Stand will perform any task within its capacities, which includes attacking someone, defending the User, or any miscellaneous order. In the case a Stand is sentient, they can occasionally advise their User that an order is unwise but will carry it on all the same. Stands are also shown to protect their users in certain instances, such as when Jotaro tries to shoot himself, or Weather Report tries to commit suicide.</p>
          <p>However, there are instances when a Stand cannot be controlled by the User. It can be either automatic, like Super Fly, or the User can acquire a Stand, but not have the fighting spirit to control it, like Holy Kujo. In both cases, a Stand can accidentally work against its user's interests through their unsupervised power. However, specifically in the second case, a Stand can go out of control and slowly kill its User like a disease. According to Muhammad Avdol, the User becomes ill, then falls into a coma only to never wake up again; moreover, such occurrences are common enough for him to claim having witnessed many people succumbing to this.</p>

          <p>One of the defining rules about Stands is that someone may only have one Stand (at a time). Although Stands may take different forms, or be split into several entities, no one is able to summon several Stands at once. Although exceptional circumstances may lead to someone wielding several Stands, only one will be the User's real Stand. A Stand generally remains attached to its User, but it can sometimes change Users. For instance, it can be stolen from its original User, or if the Stand's ability involves changing User. Thanks to Whitesnake's DISCs, a Stand can change Users but will act to protect its new User instead. Other Stands, like Anubis or Cheap Trick, will actively try to change Users, and their malevolent nature makes them harm their Users instead of protecting them.</p>
          <h3>Stand Cry<h3>
          <p>Occasionally, a Stand can utter a Stand Cry, shouting repeatedly while delivering a beatdown or displaying it's ability.</p>
